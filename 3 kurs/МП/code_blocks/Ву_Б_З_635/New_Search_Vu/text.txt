We had no irony when it came to girls, though. There was just no time to develop it. One
moment they weren't there, not in any form that interested us, anyway, and the next you couldn't
miss them; they were everywhere, all over the place. One moment you wanted to clonk them on
the head for being your sister, or someone else's sister, and the next you wanted to . . . actually,
we didn't know what we wanted next, but it was something, something. Almost overnight, all
these sisters (there was no other kind of girl, not yet) had become interesting, disturbing, even.
 See, what did we have that was any different from what we'd had before? Squeaky voices, but
a squeaky voice doesn't do much for you, really - it makes you preposterous, not desirable. And
the sprouting pubic hairs were our secret, strictly between us and our Y-fronts, and it would be
years before a member of the opposite sex could verify that they were where they should be.
Girls, on the other hand, quite clearly had breasts, and, to accompany them, a new way of
walking: arms folded over the chest, a posture which simultaneously disguised and drew
attention to what had just happened. And then there was makeup and perfume, invariably cheap,
and inexpertly, sometimes even comically, applied, but still a quite terrifying sign that things had
progressed without us, beyond us, behind our backs.
